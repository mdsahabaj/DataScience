#CREATE CUSTOMERDETAILS TABLE
-----------------------------------------------
create table CustomerDetails(
Customer_Id int primary key auto_increment,
Name varchar(20),
locality varchar(20),
amount_spend int,
industry varchar(20)
);
show tables;

#INSERT_CUSTOMER_DETAILS (WITH NULL VALUES AND DUPLICATE ENTRY)
-------------------------------------------------
insert into customerdetails value (1,'Sahabaj','Kolkata',1000,'Manufacturing');
insert into customerdetails value (2,'Bappy','Gujrat',2000,'Creative');
insert into customerdetails value (3,'Rohan','Goa',1200,'News');
insert into customerdetails value (4,'Raj','Mumbai',1500,'Tech');
insert into customerdetails value (5,'Kapil','Chennai',1070,'Teaching');
insert into customerdetails value (6,'Tanmay','Pune',1000,'Manufacturing');
insert into customerdetails value (7,'Arun','Hydrabad',null,'Aviation');
insert into customerdetails value (8,'Mohan','Bengalore',2650,'Defence');
insert into customerdetails value (9,'Salman','Punjab',5200,'Aviation');
insert into customerdetails value (10,'Munna','Delhi Ncr',1000,'Manufacturing');
insert into customerdetails value (11,'Sahabaj','Kolkata',1000,'Manufacturing');
insert into customerdetails value (12,'Tanmay','Pune',1000,'Manufacturing');

select * from customerDetails;

SQL Technique #1 – Counting Rows and Items
--------------------------------------------------
Count Function - We will begin our analysis with the simplest query, i.e, counting the number of rows in our table. We will do this by using the function – COUNT().

Query - select count(*) from customerdetails;
Ans - 12

Distinct Function - many duplicate industry value is there so count unique number of industry 

Query -  select distinct industry from CustomerDetails;
  select count( distinct industry)from CustomerDetails;
Answer -7

SQL Technique #2 – Aggregation Functions
---------------------------------------------
SUM,AVG,STDDEV
Query -   select sum(amount_spend) as TotalAmount, avg(amount_spend) as averageAmount,stddev(amount_spend) as Standard_Deviation from customerDetails;

Ans-	TotalAmount	averageAmount	Standard_Deviation
	  18620	          1692.7273	1220.2391040588645

SQL Technique #3 – Extreme Value Identification
---------------------------------------------------
max,min function
Query -     select max(amount_spend) as MaxAmount, min(amount_spend) as minAmount from customerDetails;
ans-	MaxAmount	minAmount
	  5200	          1000

SQL Technique #4 – Slicing Data
-------------------------------------
Where clause with arthmatic and logical operator,group by , having clause

1.finding null value in amount
Query -select * from CustomerDetails where amount_spend is null;
   select count (*) from CustomerDetails where amount_spend is not null;
ans-1 row null 11 not null 

2- find all details about manufacturing industry
Q-  select * from customerdetails where industry ='manufacturing';
A- 	1	Sahabaj	Sahabaj Nagar	1000	Manufacturing
	6	Tanmay	Pune	1000	Manufacturing
	10	Munna	Delhi Ncr	1000	Manufacturing
	11	Sahabaj	Kolkata	1000	Manufacturing
	12	Tanmay	Pune	1000	Manufacturing

3-Total amount spent in teaching 
Q-  select sum(amount_spend) as Total_amount_spent_teaching from customerdetails group by industry having industry ='teaching';

SQL Technique #5 – Limiting Data
-------------------------------------------
limit and offset

Q-  select * from customerdetails limit 2 offset 3;
(offset is use to skip First 3 row , when we want to see 4 and 5 then we use  offset and limit)

A-	4	Raj	Mumbai	1500	Tech
	5	Kapil	Chennai	1070	Teaching

SQL Technique #6 – Sorting Data
 Order By
Q-   Select * from customerdetails order by amount_spend;

 A- 	7	Arun	Hydrabad		Aviation
	1	Sahabaj	Sahabaj Nagar	1000	Manufacturing
	6	Tanmay	Pune	1000	Manufacturing
	10	Munna	Delhi Ncr	1000	Manufacturing
	11	Sahabaj	Kolkata	1000	Manufacturing
	12	Tanmay	Pune	1000	Manufacturing
	5	Kapil	Chennai	1070	Teaching
	3	Rohan	Goa	1200	News
	4	Raj	Mumbai	1500	Tech
	2	Bappy	Gujrat	2000	Creative
	8	Mohan	Bengalore	2650	Defence
	9	Salman	Punjab	5200	Aviation

SQL Technique #7 – Filtering Patterns
-------------------------------------------

Like and Wildcard Characters
1.finding all customer details where name starts with s
Q-  select * from customerdetails where name like 's%';

a-	1	Sahabaj	Sahabaj Nagar	1000	Manufacturing
	9	Salman	Punjab	5200	Aviation
	11	Sahabaj	Kolkata	1000	Manufacturing







SQL Technique #8 – Groupings, Rolling up Data and Filtering in Groups
1.Total amount spent in industry wise
Q-    select sum(amount_spend) as Total_amount, industry from customerdetails group by industry;

a-	Total_amount	industry
	5000	Manufacturing
	2000	Creative
	1200	News
	1500	Tech
	1070	Teaching
	5200	Aviation
	2650	Defence
